    These overlays have varying amounts of scanline beam width variation/glow/overdrive effect.

    The lowest numbered overlays have the sharpest scanlines and no glow/overdrive. The highest numbered overlays have the most glow/overdrive and the most beam width variation.

    The “classic” scanline overlays are still here, they’ve just been renamed as options 1 and 2.

    Instructions

    For these overlays to work properly, you must:

        1. choose an overlay with a resolution that matches the video resolution being used by RetroArch (e.g. use one of the 1920x1080 overlays if you’re using 1920x1080 for the video resolution).

        2. enable integer scaling. (settings -> video -> integer scale -> ON)

        3. set the aspect ratio to “custom.” (settings -> video -> aspect ratio -> “custom”)

        4. set the custom viewport x/y to an appropriate size. Set “custom aspect ratio height” to 4x or 5x if using 1920x1080 as the video resolution; if using 1280x720 as the video resolution, set “custom aspect ratio height” to 3x (settings -> video -> custom aspect ratio height)

    Enjoy!
